          <p> This website features the projects I worked on throughout the semester in Art 74. The overall theme is a cutesy blog like website - a stark contrast to most of the themes I presented in my projects. This was my first time ever experimenting with web design, as well as making my own website so everything was difficult to learn at first. A few of the code I added I learned mostly from W3schools, such as the navigation menu and the split columns. But soon I was able to pick up the language and figured out how to edit it by myself. Before I knew it, I found myself enjoying the process and even had fun making it. </p>

          <p>The latest edition to my Art 74 ePortfolio is my 5th project, the ArtWare. I wanted this project to match the overall aesthetic and theme of my website, so I chose matching colors and cute images.</p>
          <p>For this project, I experimented with javascript and played around with the code mostly from the book Getting Started With p5.Js. This was alot harder to learn than HTML and css because it is a different language than the two. I did have alot of trouble adding a few more elements to my project but in the end I chose to keep it sweet and simple.</p>
