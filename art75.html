                     <p>This studio workshop course is an in-depth study of video as an art form in the context of Digital Media Art. We will look at trends in Video Art History through the lens of our current cultural and technological moment. For example, how do surveillance, Internet culture, social media, and new video recording technologies inform Video and New Media art practices? Projects will encourage students to take a critical approach to defining characteristics of video and related technologies. Students will explore various platforms for showing digital video art, including single- and multi- channel video, installation, social media, and interactive websites. Artistic voice is emphasized over technical skills.</p>

                      <p>This collage is dedicated to my love for birds and the freedom they represent. Everywhere we go, we see these hordes of feathered friends take off in flight, leaving us to wonder where they go and what lands they reach. I admire their ability to soar and fly freely in the sky, leaving their worries on the ground. From this, I wanted the audience to experience the same happiness I feel surrounded by birds and ignore the pressure of fitting in society.</p>

                      <p> This was my first time since High School using photoshop and although it took a few days to relearn how the tools works, I quickly got the hand of things. I always find photoshop fun to work with and got a little
                            carried away on this piece. But overall, I really liked how this piece turned out.</p>

                     <p>I often view social media as a stage, where performers display the best of their abilities. Whether its art, beauty, comedy - you gain attention from those who view them. At times, we find ourselves being addicted to our popularity, forcing ourselves to post more for more views. From this, we gain this false sense of happiness. And other times, we find ourselves the losing performers compared to those with a higher following, leaving us to feel worthless and unimportant. Fake.hapiness is supposed to bring out the negativity of social media. Our character in this video represents our mentality, where we begin to like the “audience” who watch us, forcing ourselves to post more and as we continue this cycle, we slowly lose our minds.</p>
                     </br>
                     <p>This video was actually inspired by my friend’s situation, in which she began to feel badly depressed, partly because of the influence of social media. I was able to understand her situation because I often worried about the same things as her. I wanted to bring up facades, insecurity, false happiness, addiction, and even the factor of an invasion of privacy. Maybe not all of these components can be seen, but people can interpret this video however they want.</p>

                     <p>My 3D model is inspired by the damage we humans cause towards nature, where our actions leads to destruction of many plants and animals. Here, mother nature towers above everyone as she moderates the balance between humans and nature. However, as time progresses, we humans begin to take advantage of our resources, ruining this balance. Within the box lies the heart of the Earth, which humans are seizing and as this happens, mother nature is slowly deteriorating by the hands of mankind. Coup D'état illustrates this takeover of mankind that consumes everything in its path. There isn't much detail but I hope the message was able to go through to those that see it.</p>
