                <p>The goal of this course is to establish a foundational digital literacy. Keep in mind that this class is an introduction on how to use hypermedia to make contemporary forms of art; it is not a software training course. The intention of this class is to use our modern age technology as environments rather than digital tools at our disposal. General understanding of the political/social/aesthetic implications of living in a digital age will be developed; in addition to experimenting with meta-mediums and ideas of how the logic of the art world and the logic of new media may be contrary.
