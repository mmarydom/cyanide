        <h1>My name is Cole Pergerson</h1>
        <p>
          I'm currently a student studying digital media art at San Jose State Univeristy. My main focus is game development
          and I have been using Unity3d for about two years. Right now I'm interested in creating first person viewed games
          because those games force players to pay attention to their environment. This gives me the opportunity to make very detailed
          virtual levels. More importantly, interacting with the game mechanics is more intimate.
          <br><br>
          I like to take a different approach to exploring in games. Instead of roaming vast terrians, I prefer the player to examine
          the small details. Using your brain makes finding secrets more awarding. In my first person viewed games, I try to limit
          the amount of UI and instead give clues from the environment.
