                  <p>This portfolio features the projects I’ve done throughout Art 74 and Art 75, as well as a few from other classes or outside of school assignments. Most of these pieces consist of the same idea that revolve around problems with our society, technology, or sometimes even both. A lot of the issues I discuss revolve around the detrimental side-effects when indulging in social media or even with our personal devices. As someone who advocates against the stigma in mentalhealth, these projects emphasize the negative influences these factors have on the human mind. Although nowadays I tackle more of the issues with society, I still delve into technology’s bad side.</p>
                  </br>
                  <p>Regarding my art projects, a few can be surreal or hard to understand since I portray my messages through dark themes, sometimes even with a “cute” façade. While in some cases my negative emotions act as an influencer to these pieces, most of the time it is just my personal taste and aesthetics. For me, art acts as my coping mechanism when I can’t reach out to those I trust. When there are too many horrible things in the world, I have the need to express my emotions through art. I want to reach out to those who find comfort or fascination in my work, and to tell them to be more aware of your position in society.</p>
                  </br>
                  <p>As a digital media artist, there are so many digital art mediums that I want to explore. And with the university providing these resources to little or no cost, I use them to my advantage as much as possible. In many of these projects, I use these programs to my utmost capabilities to portray my messages in whatever way I can. Although I have previous knowledge with coding, photoshop, and adobe premiere pro during my high school and early college years, I am still less than proficient in most of these programs. However, I am always ready to refine these skills and broaden my knowledge. I am excited to see what these next few years have in store for me, and I can't wait to make more friends along the way!</p>

                  <p>About my little assistant floating around: He is a defected android named Cyan and I plan on making him the mascot of my social media accounts. I have always been fascinated by the idea of androids or AI, and so I created one as a make-believe companion. During days I don’t feel like posting about myself, he will be there to take my place. He is still very new and I am currently working on the piece that will be his debut into the world! Hope you love him as much as I do ^^</p>
